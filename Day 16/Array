Array datastructure
  An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple
  items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by 
  simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array 
  (generally denoted by the name of the array).
 
Python:
  Lists are equivalent to arrays.
  In  Python a list can be created as
  list_name = [list_elements]
 
 C++:
  C++ has two ways of implementing arrays:
    1. Declaring Array:
      data_type array_name [array_size];
     2. Using Vectors
