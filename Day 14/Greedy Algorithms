Greedy Algorithms

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next 
piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally 
optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.

Example:
Knapssack Problem
  Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W 
to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
